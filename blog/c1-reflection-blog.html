    <h1>Reflections</h1>

      <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
      <p>I like EDA's combination of both hard and soft skills approach.</p>


      <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
      <p>First impressions are that it is going to be both challenging and very rewarding at the same time.</p>


      <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
      <p>I think i will fit in well with the culture of EDA. </p>


      <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
      <p>I think i am even more excited now to get into the materials and learn to code :D</p>

      <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?  Does it make you nervous?</h4>
      <p>I think this kind of learning environment will suit me very well.  The only thing that really worries me is having enough to complete the assignments/learning whilst still working.</p>
