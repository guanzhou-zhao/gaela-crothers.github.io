    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
      <p></p>
    
    <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
      <p>I tried the Pomodoro technique and meditation.</p>
    
    <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>
     <p>I found the mediatation app helped to calm me before i went to sleep, when my mind would often be thinking about all the things that i needed to do. Also making sure i have down time before bed to swtich off. </p>
    
    <h2>what worked for you?</h2>
      <p>The Pomodoro was interesting for me, as i tend to get distracted pretty easily, but once i get stuck into something i dont want to leave. So it was a way of kind of tricking my mind into doing more. Having a shower before bed also a good way to relax.</p>
    
    <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>h2>
    <p>I will continue to look at multiple ways of managing my time and relaxation methods as this journey continues</p>
